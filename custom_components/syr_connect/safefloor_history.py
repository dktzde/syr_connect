"""Measurement history of SafeFloor sensors as external statistics.

The problem
-----------
SafeFloor Connect sensors are battery powered. They measure every getWMP seconds
(e.g. every 6 hours) but upload to the cloud only every getRCP seconds (e.g. every
4 days, configurable by the user). The regular status therefore only carries the
latest measurement: the temperature and humidity sensor entities stay flat for
days and then jump. GetSafeFloorStatistics (report type 4) returns the raw
measurements of the last 6 days with their timestamps.

Why external statistics and not the history of the sensor entities
------------------------------------------------------------------
Home Assistant offers integrations one supported way to store values with a
timestamp in the past: external statistics, written with
``async_add_external_statistics`` ("Add hourly statistics from an external
source"). It was added for exactly this purpose (home-assistant/architecture
discussion #559, "inject historical data"), and core integrations whose data
arrives late from a cloud use it the same way (e.g. opower, tibber, suez_water,
ista_ecotrend, solaredge).

The other places are either impossible or not meant for integrations:

* State history: an entity only has a current state. There is no API to set
  past states, so the flat line in the history of the sensor entities can not be
  corrected. It is not wrong either: it shows what was known at that time.
* Long-term statistics of the sensor entities: these rows belong to the recorder
  (source "recorder"), which compiles every hour exactly once from the recorded
  states. ``async_import_statistics`` is meant for an "internal source" and no
  core integration uses it for its own entities. Writing an hour the recorder has
  not compiled yet makes its next compile run fail on duplicate rows, and that
  hour is then lost for *all* sensors. Using it safely would depend on recorder
  internals that may change with any Home Assistant release.

External statistics belong to this integration (statistic ID
``syr_connect:<serial>_<key>``, source ``syr_connect``). The recorder never
compiles them, so their rows can be written and rewritten at any time without
touching data of Home Assistant, of the sensor entities or of other
integrations.

An external statistic is not a new sensor: it is no entity, has no state, no
entity registry entry and can not be used in automations. It is only the time
series of the real measurements and shows up wherever statistics can be
selected (statistics graph card, Developer tools > Statistics). The sensor
entities are unchanged and keep showing the latest uploaded value. See the
README section "SafeFloor Measurement History".

How the rows are built
----------------------
Long-term statistics have an hourly resolution. Every hour from the first to the
last measurement gets a row: an hour that contains measurements gets their mean,
min and max (one measurement: its value), an hour without a measurement takes
over the row of the hour before exactly. Nothing is interpolated or
extrapolated: hours after the last measurement are left out and follow with the
next upload. Importing the same 6-day window again overwrites the same rows.
