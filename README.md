## Installation

### Home Assistant Community Store - [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Search for "SYR Connect"
4. Click "Install"
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `syr_connect` folder to your `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

The integration supports two configuration modes:

### Cloud API Setup (All Devices)

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "+ Add Integration"
3. Search for "SYR Connect"
4. Choose "Cloud Access"
5. Enter your SYR Connect App credentials:
   - **Username**: Your SYR Connect account email
   - **Password**: Your SYR Connect account password

### Local API Setup (Newer Devices Only)

For devices with local JSON API support (NeoSoft 2500/5000 Connect, SafeTech Connect, TRIO DFR/LS Connect):

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "+ Add Integration"
3. Search for "SYR Connect"
4. Choose "Local Access"
5. Enter the device information:
   - **Device Model**: Select your device model (e.g. NeoSoft 2500 Connect)
   - **Host**: IP address of your device (e.g., `192.168.178.199`)

**Note**: To find your device's IP address, check your router's DHCP client list or the device's display menu.

**Important**: For stable operation, the device must have a **static IP address** or a **reserved DHCP lease** (DHCP reservation). If the device's IP address changes, the integration will lose connection and needs to be reconfigured. Alternatively, you can use a hostname if your network supports local DNS resolution.

## Features

The integration automatically creates entities for all your SYR Connect devices.

**Note**: If the device is visible in your SYR Connect account, the integration will discover it and create the entities automatically. If you own an "untested device", it is helpful to share the diagnostic data to find out whether there are any unknown values or whether everything is working as desired. This also allows the list of tested devices to be continuously expanded.

- **Requirements**: Internet connection, SYR Connect account

#### Local API (JSON-based)

- **Supported by**: Select newer models with built-in local API (NeoSoft 2500/5000 Connect, SafeTech Connect, TRIO DFR/LS Connect)
- **Connection**: Direct to device via local network (port 5333)
- **Authentication**: No credentials required
- **Advantages**: No internet dependency, faster response times, no cloud rate limits
- **Requirements**: Device must be on same network as Home Assistant, device needs static IP address or hostname

The integration automatically detects which API mode to use based on the configuration provided during setup.

## How Data is Updated

The integration polls the device API at regular intervals (default: 60 seconds). The update process depends on the API mode:

### Cloud API Update Process

1. **Login**: Authenticates with the SYR Connect cloud API using your credentials
2. **Device Discovery**: Retrieves all projects and devices associated with your account
3. **Status Updates**: For each device, fetches current status including all sensor values
4. **Entity Updates**: Updates all Home Assistant entities with the latest values
5. **SafeFloor Measurement History**: After each new upload of a SafeFloor sensor, writes its individual measurements into the long-term statistics of its temperature and humidity sensors (see below)

### SafeFloor Measurement History

SafeFloor sensors run on batteries: they measure temperature and humidity regularly (e.g. every 6 hours) but upload to the cloud only every few days (upload interval configurable in the SYR app). The sensor entities therefore only show the latest measurement and jump at each upload.

After each upload the integration additionally fetches the individual measurements of the last 6 days from the cloud and writes them into the long-term statistics of the temperature and humidity sensor. Each measurement is valid until the next one, so every hour gets the value that was really measured at that time instead of the flat line. Long-term statistics have an hourly resolution; an hour with a new measurement gets the time-weighted mean, min and max. Nothing is interpolated. The corrected values show up in the **Statistics graph** card, in the history graph for periods older than the recorder's `purge_keep_days`, and in every other card that uses long-term statistics.

- Only hours that Home Assistant has already compiled are overwritten; the integration never adds a row. This avoids any conflict with the recorder, which compiles each hour once after it has ended. The hour of the upload is corrected by a second fetch about 75 minutes later; without new uploads the history is fetched again once a day.
- The recent state history (history graph of the last days) and the 5-minute statistics can not be changed afterwards and still show the flat line and the jump.
- Cloud API only (the local API has no history); the Home Assistant recorder must be enabled.
- The cloud provides the last 6 days only. With an upload interval longer than 6 days, older measurements of an upload are lost.

### Local API Update Process

1. **Status Updates**: Directly fetches device status from the local endpoint
2. **Entity Updates**: Updates all Home Assistant entities with the latest values

The local API is faster and doesn't depend on internet connectivity, making it more reliable for real-time monitoring and automations.

If a device becomes unavailable (e.g., offline or communication error), its entities are marked as unavailable until the next successful update.

### Known Limitations

- **Cloud Dependency**: The cloud API requires an active internet connection and functioning SYR Connect cloud service
- **Update Interval**: Minimum recommended update interval is 60 seconds to avoid API rate limiting when using cloud API
- **Limited Write Access**: Configuration changes (regeneration time, salt amounts, intervals) and control actions (regeneration, valve control) are supported, but some advanced settings may only be available through the SYR Connect App
- **Local API Support**: Only some newer device models (NeoSoft 2500/5000 Connect, SafeTech Connect, TRIO DFR/LS Connect) provide a local JSON API. Most other models, including all LEXplus variants, require cloud API access

## Use Cases & Examples

### Automation Examples

#### Low Salt Alert

Get notified when salt supply is running low:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: Low Salt Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getss1
        below: 2  # Less than 2 weeks of salt remaining
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Water Softener Alert"
          message: "Salt supply low - less than 2 weeks remaining"
```

#### Daily Regeneration Report

Get a daily summary of regeneration activity:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: Daily Regeneration Report"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "20:00:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Water Softener Daily Report"
          message: >
            Regenerations today: {{ states('sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getnor') }}
            Remaining capacity: {{ states('sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getres') }}L
            Salt supply: {{ states('sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getss1') }} weeks
```

#### Alarm Notification

Immediate notification when an alarm is triggered:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: Alarm Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getalm') != 'no_alarm' }}"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "⚠️ Water Softener Alarm"
          message: "Check your SYR device - alarm detected! Current alarm: {{ states('sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getalm') }}"
          data:
            priority: high
```

#### Water Flow Monitoring

Alert on unusually high water flow (possible leak):

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: High Flow Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getflo
        above: 20  # Flow rate above 20 L/min
        for:
          minutes: 5
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "High Water Flow Detected"
          message: "Unusual water flow - check for leaks!"
```

#### Leak Sensor — Close Water Valve

Automatically close the water valve when a leak sensor detects water. This example uses the standard `valve.close` service to close the SYR water shut-off valve. Replace the entity IDs with the correct IDs from your system. Test very carefully that this automation works correctly, as it can become a critical safety action.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: Close Valve On Leak"
    description: "Set SYR valve to closed (setAB = true) when a leak sensor detects water."
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.house_leak_sensor
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: valve.close
        target:
          entity_id: valve.syr_connect_<serial_number>_getab
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "SYR: Leak detected — valve closed"
          message: "Water leak detected — SYR water shut-off valve has been closed automatically."
```

#### Scheduled Regeneration Override

Trigger regeneration at a specific time:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SYR: Weekend Regeneration"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "03:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - sat
          - sun
    action:
      - service: button.press
        target:
          entity_id: button.syr_connect_<serial_number>_setsir
```

**Note**: Replace `<serial_number>` with your actual device serial number in all examples.

### High CPU/Memory usage

- **Increase scan interval**: Set a higher value (e.g., 120-300 seconds) in integration options
- This reduces API calls and system load

## Dependencies

The integration requires the following Python packages:

- `pycryptodomex>=3.19.0,<4.0`: For AES encryption/decryption
- `defusedxml>=0.7.1,<1.0`: For secure XML parsing (prevents XXE attacks)

**Note**: The integration uses `defusedxml` for secure XML parsing and `pycryptodomex` (not `pycryptodome`) to avoid conflicts with Home Assistant's built-in crypto libraries.

This package is **automatically installed** by Home Assistant when you:

1. Add the integration through the UI
2. Restart Home Assistant after installation
