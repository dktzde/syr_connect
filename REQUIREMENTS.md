# System Requirements for SYR Connect Integration

## Home Assistant Requirements

- **Home Assistant Version**: 2024.1.0 or higher (recommended: latest stable)
- **Python Version**: 3.11 or higher (included in Home Assistant)

## Development Requirements

For running tests and development:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-homeassistant-custom-component pytest-cov
```

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=custom_components.syr_connect --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```

### Development Emulator

For testing without a real SYR device, use the **SYR Connect Emulator**:

**Repository**: <https://github.com/alexhass/syr_connect_emulator>

The emulator provides:

- Full JSON API implementation (port 5333) for local device testing
- Simulated device responses for various SYR models (SafeTech, NeoSoft)
- Perfect for integration development, testing, and debugging
- It cannot be guaranteed that it will work exactly the same way 100% of the time. Please report issues to fix them.

To use the emulator and install to Apache:

1. Clone the emulator:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexhass/syr_connect_emulator.git
   ```

2. Configure the integration to use your webservers hostname or IP as the device host
3. Select "Local Access" mode when adding the integration hub

The emulator responds to all standard API calls and allows testing features without accessing real devices.

## Python Package Requirements

The following packages will be automatically installed by Home Assistant:

### Required Packages

1. **pycryptodomex** (>=3.19.0,<4.0)
   - Purpose: AES encryption/decryption for API communication
   - License: BSD, Public Domain
   - Note: Uses `pycryptodomex` (not `pycryptodome`) to avoid conflicts with Home Assistant's crypto libraries

2. **defusedxml** (==0.7.1)
   - Purpose: Secure XML parsing to prevent XXE (XML External Entity) attacks
   - License: Python Software Foundation License
   - Note: Replaces the built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree` with a hardened version

## Network Requirements

- **Internet Connection**: Required for cloud API access
- **API Endpoint**: <https://syrconnect.de/WebServices/>
- **Ports**: 443 (HTTPS)

## Installation Verification

After installing the integration in Home Assistant:

1. Check that requirements are installed:
   - Go to **Settings > System > Logs**
   - Look for any `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`
   - If requirements are missing, restart Home Assistant

2. Verify integration loads:
   - Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
   - Check if "SYR Connect" appears in the list
   - If not visible, check logs for errors

3. Test connection:
   - Add the integration with your credentials
   - Check if devices are discovered
   - Verify sensors show data

## Common Issues

### Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cryptodome'` or `No module named 'defusedxml'`

**Solution**: Restart Home Assistant to trigger automatic installation of required packages (pycryptodomex and defusedxml)

### Issue: `ImportError: cannot import name 'AES' from 'Crypto.Cipher'`

**Solution**: This indicates a conflict with the old pycryptodome package. The integration now uses pycryptodomex which avoids this conflict.

### Issue: Integration not appearing in list

**Solution**:

1. Verify the folder structure is correct: `config/custom_components/syr_connect/`
2. Check that all required files are present
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Check logs for any Python syntax errors

## Manual Dependency Installation (Advanced)

If automatic installation fails, you can manually install the dependencies:

```bash
# For Home Assistant Container/OS
docker exec -it homeassistant pip install "pycryptodomex>=3.19.0,<4.0" "defusedxml>=0.7.1,<1.0"

# For Home Assistant Core
source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
pip install "pycryptodomex>=3.19.0,<4.0" "defusedxml>=0.7.1,<1.0"
```
